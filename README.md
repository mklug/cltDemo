### CLT Demo ###

These are a few short Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the LLN and CLT for some 
very simple ditributions.  Namely, the cases of fair coin tosses, fair dice rolls, 
1-dimensional random walks, and continuous uniform distributions.  These were 
used for a math circles demonstration.
